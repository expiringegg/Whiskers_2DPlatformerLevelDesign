# 2DPlatformerLevelDesign

**Project description**

For the project we were asked to create a 2D platformer that follows similar gameplay to popular titles such as Hollow Knight. The game is to have two levels (areas/scenes) that explore the best practices in the 2D platformer genre. This task required us to have the following requirements in the game:

Player controller
- Jump
- Double Jump
- Dash
- Attack

Game Mechanics
- AI Enemies / NPCâ€™s
- Movement / Patrols for AI
- Respawning / Checkpoints
- Unlockable Abilities
- Dynamic Camera Controls

The abilities are supposed to let you progress through the game, without a certain ability the player should not be able to move onto next main area.
Using combinations of abilities to traverse is desirable. The game and flow should feel good for the player and feel polished.

Deadline is 19th March 2021.

**Theory Explored**

during the first bit of research i focused hard on how to get engaging level design to get the player immersed in my game.
how to develop engaging level designs 
the use of mechanics and puzzles to traverse. 

accessibility was a huge thing i tried to put my time into to give any player the best experience. i wanted the game to control through only the keyboard for someone who may have limited mobility as well as implementing a controls for the same reason as well for a player who prefers to use controller.
